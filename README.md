# Tyler Willingham - Resume
[website](https://twilling.io) | [github](http://github.com/tylerwillingham) | [linkedin](http://linkedin.com/in/tylerwillingham)

I'm a pragmatic, technical leader with a passion for building products that delight users. My career has been a mix of time spent at start-ups helping iterate quickly, but sustainably in order to regularly ship features to users, test them and continue iterating. I have also learned to tune my craft at scale, constantly thinking about instrumentation, performance, and shipping iterations with zero downtime.

You won't find a college degree in my background. I began my career working independently as a freelancer in 2009 before finishing high school. In 2011 I took an agency job and have
been a full-time software engineer ever since. I have people management experience but I believe my impact is greatest when I can apply my technical skillset through a wide lens, collaborating across technical, product, and design teams to build predictable, maintainable systems and highly aligned teams. My self-taught background naturally motivates me to mentor other engineers through thoughtful code review and frequent pair programming.

Ruby, Rails, React, TypeScript, GraphQL, Sidekiq, Kafka, DataDog, BuildKite, AWS

#### Acting Staff Engineer - Shopify Logistics

_January 2023 - May 2023_

As a technical leader for the Claims team I worked with engineers to design and implement maintainable and iterative improvements to the existing serverless Claims service after a period significant period without ownership. In a few short months we:

- Refactored legacy, highly procedural business logic into smaller, single-responsibility classes with more thorough test coverage
- Refined instrumentation to provide key product health insight for technical and non-technical stakeholders
- Shipped incremental improvements to our core Claims data model, including zero-downtime strangler-fig migration of data
- Took over maintenance and development of distributed API client
- Improved performance to the most business critical endpoints by > 5x
  + Required introducing new AWS infrastructure
- Iteratively migrated from deprecated ORM to modern alternative
- Identified and implemented database-level performance improvements
  + Leveraged new instrumentation to target long-running queries deserving of new indexes
  + Targeted index additions to suppor data-integrity concerns
  + Removed foreign key constraints to support online schema migration tooling
- Began work to enable self-serve Claims for additional merchants

In addition to these domain-specific wins I also contributed to more broad impact initiatives such as:

- Prototyped high-throughput Kafka-based eventing system leveraging Shopify's production-grade Kafka clusters
  + GraphQL API
- Contributed to an organization-wide effort to test and replace a deprecated NodeJS ORM with a modern alternative
  + Spiked on two frameworks (Prisma, TypeORM)
  + Presented to technical leadership committee
  + Developed key tooling and playbook for other teams to follow for seamless transitions
- Led initiative to replace default serverless build tooling with alternative
  + Reduced deploy sizes by ~6x
  + Reduced time-to-deploy by ~50%
  + Reduced lambda cold-boot by ~60%
- Collaborated with product engineering to assist with organization-wide efforts to define repeatable, blue-green database migration process for reducing downtime caused by database schema changes

Unfortunately my time with Shopify and Shopify Logistics was [cut short due to broad, performance-agnostic cuts](https://news.shopify.com/important-team-and-business-changes).
