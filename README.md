# Tyler Willingham - Resume
[website](https://twilling.io) | [github](http://github.com/tylerwillingham) | [linkedin](http://linkedin.com/in/tylerwillingham)

I am a pragmatic engineer with a passion for building features across the full-stack. I have found a
particular interest in working at startups and growing their offerings with maintainability and
scale in mind while balancing a user-oriented mindset.

I began my career working independently as a freelancer in 2009. In 2011 I took an agency job and have
been employed full-time ever since. I have individual contributor experience as well as considerable
team-lead experience.  As someone who is self-taught, I benefited from working closely with other
engineers to learn and grow and as I continue to do that, I have also developed a special passion
for helping others grow.

I care about developing responsible and maintainable software. My aim is to
write code that is so readable that it looks boring. "Code golf"
isn't my sport. I rely on community-trusted libraries to increase productivity
and keep my teams from maintaining software that's not core to our business needs.
