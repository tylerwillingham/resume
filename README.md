I'm a web developer with experience across the full stack, from front-end development to light dev-ops work. My development education comes 100% from experience. I began learning in middle school and landed my first freelance jobs before I could drive a car.

My favorite part of software development is creating meaninginful solutions to difficult problems. Programming is fun and I'm constantly looking into new technologies but I recognize that software developers are problem-solvers and that's the primary reason I decided to pursue web development as a career.
