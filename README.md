I'm a pragmatic, technical leader with a passion for building products that delight users. My career has been a mix of time spent at start-ups helping iterate quickly, but sustainably in order to regularly ship features to users, test them and continue iterating. I have also learned to tune my craft at scale, constantly thinking about instrumentation, performance, and shipping iterations with zero downtime.

As a technical leader for the Claims team I worked with engineers to design and implement maintainable and iterative improvements to the existing serverless Claims service after a period significant period without ownership. In a few short months we:

  + GraphQL API
- Contributed to an organization-wide effort to test and replace a deprecated NodeJS ORM with a modern alternative
  + Spiked on two frameworks (Prisma, TypeORM)
  + Presented to technical leadership committee
  + Developed key tooling and playbook for other teams to follow for seamless transitions
- Led initiative to replace default serverless build tooling with alternative
  + Reduced deploy sizes by ~6x
  + Reduced time-to-deploy by ~50%
  + Reduced lambda cold-boot by ~60%
- Collaborated with product engineering to assist with organization-wide efforts to define repeatable, blue-green database migration process for reducing downtime caused by database schema changes
