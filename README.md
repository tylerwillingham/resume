# Tyler Willingham - Resume
[website](https://twilling.io) | [github](http://github.com/tylerwillingham) | [linkedin](http://linkedin.com/in/tylerwillingham)

My love for building things is why I became a software engineer. I am a self-taught, full-stack
engineer. I've spent all of my career working for start-ups, first in an agency-like capacity, then
in-house.

I began my career working independently as a freelancer in 2009. In 2011 I took an agency job and have
been employed full-time ever since. I have individual contributor experience as well as considerable
team-lead experience.  As someone who is self-taught, I benefited from working closely with other
engineers to learn and grow and as I continue to do that, I have also developed a special passion
for helping others grow.

I care about developing responsible and maintainable software. My aim is to
write code that looks boring and therefor approachable to beginners. "Code golf"
isn't my sport. I rely on community-trusted libraries to increase productivity
and keep my teams from maintaining software that's secondary or tertiary to our
primary goal.
